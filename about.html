    <h1>Our Story</h1>
    <div class="bg-secondary text-white">I have always loved the idea of coffee. I also love the idea of sharing conersations
        and stories with my friends/family and even people I don't know over the simple drink.
        I was introduced to coffee roasting back in 2014 from my cousin. He let me have one of his
        older coffee roasters and I got to practice on that and actually make it to drink with!
        I love this business and I cannot wait to do business with you and share my coffee roasts
        with you and your family! I look forward to doing business!!
